			<p id="text-content"> I am pleased to introduce you our institution and explore the ways we connect students to a world of possibilities. Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology, founded by Bhartiya Brahmin Charitable trust in 2005, has made rapid strides in its very little time of existence because of clear focus, sustained efforts and commitment to deliver.
				<br></br>
				<br></br> We at BPIT are currently engaged in strengthening our knowledge infrastructure to transform it into a world className institute. Our talented faculty place teaching as their highest priority and teach students to move from the realm of ideas to real-world application.
				<br></br>
				<br></br> The college is committed to inculcate in its students the pursuit of individual excellence and participation in the full range of academic, spiritual, cultural, social and physical activities to make them evolve as all rounders. The campus life encourages students to dream and realize the professional growth in a congenial environment. The output of BPIT in respect of research and innovation is expected to impart new knowledge creation and development of new technologies.
				<br></br>
				<br></br> BPIT is well poised to surpass its own milestones of achievements and serve the engineering and management fraternity with unconditional commitment and fullest dedication. I am proud to say that our students step out from the institute with self-confidence and knowledge to excel in their career. I invite you to our institute to discover the unique experience and find a pathway to a bright future.
