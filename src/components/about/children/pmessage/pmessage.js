			<p id="text-content"> Education is not only a platform to develop the total personality of a person, but also a medium to transform the society into a caring, collaborative and responsible unit of cultured individuals. Our institution is committed to provide the highest possible standards of teaching, research and innovation to its students. However, this commitment has been possible under the able guidance of our Honâ€™ble Chairman Sir Sh. Atam Prakash Kaushik ji and due to the hard work and dedication of highly skilled and professional faculty members associated with this institute. Our vision goals are far beyond the academic excellence. We want our students to grow as leaders in various spheres. I pray to God to bless my students so that they have an excellent career ahead.
